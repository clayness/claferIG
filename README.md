Clafer Instance Generator
=========================

v0.3.5.17-01-2014

[Clafer](http://clafer.org) is a powerful (equivalent to first-order predicate logic) yet lightweight structural modeling language. Despite simplicity and conciseness of Clafer, writing correct models remains challenging due to hard-to-predict interactions among all constraints expressed in the model. **Clafer instance generator** (ClaferIG) is an interactive tool that generates instances and counter examples of concrete clafers in a Clafer model. If the concrete clafers do not have contradicting constraints, the generator produces valid instance data. Otherwise, the generator produces an unsatisfiable core which included all contradicting constraints and generates a counter example by removing one constraint from the core. The generator can potentially produce many instances if the concrete clafers are not fully specialized. The generator produces different instances on-demand. With these capabilities, the instance generator can be used for debugging models: checking the consistency of the model and detecting under- and
overconstraining of the model. The instance generator can also be used programmatically via API (the command line and interactive session interfaces only use the API).

Getting Clafer Tools
--------------------

Getting Clafer Tools
--------------------

Binary distributions of the release 0.3.5 of Clafer Tools for Windows, Mac, and Linux, 
can be downloaded from [Clafer Tools - Binary Distributions](http://http://gsd.uwaterloo.ca/clafer-tools-binary-distributions). 
Clafer Wiki requires Haskell Platform and MinGW to run on Windows. 

In case these binaries do not work on your particular machine configuration, the tools can be built from source code, as described below.

### Dependencies for running

* [Clafer](https://github.com/gsdlab/clafer) v0.3.5
* [Java Platform (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) v6+, 32bit
* [Alloy4.1](http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/download.html)

### Installation

1. download the binaries and unpack `<target directory>` of your choice
2. add the `<target directory>` to your system path so that the executables can be found
3. copy Alloy 4.1's jar to the `<target directory>/tools` folder

Integration with Sublime Text 2
-------------------------------

See [IDEs/claferIG-README.md](IDEs/claferIG-README.md)

Building & Installation From Source Code
----------------------------------------

### Additional dependencies for building

* [Clafer compiler](https://github.com/gsdlab/clafer) (to produce Alloy models (`.als`)). The version number of the compiler must match the version of the instance generator.
* On Linux, might need to manually install `zlib1g-dev` and `libncurses5-dev` to build one of Haskell packages on which ClaferIG depends
  * on Ubuntu, execute `sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev`

On Windows 

* [MinGW+MSYS](http://mingw.org) 
  * since the Haskell Platform already contains MinGW, you may choose to install MinGW+MSYS to the same location, e.g., `c:\...\Haskell Platform\2013.2.0.0`
  * add the `bin` folders of MinGW (`MinGW\bin`) and MSYS (`MinGW\MSYS\1.0\bin`) to your system path
  * `unzip` will be automatically installed 

### Important: Branches must correspond

All related projects are following the *simultaneous release model*. 
The branch `master` contains releases, whereas the branch `develop` contains code under development. 
When building the tools, the branches should match.
Releases from branches 'master` are guaranteed to work well together.
Development versions from branches `develop` should work well together but this might not always be the case.
### Building

1. install the [Clafer compiler](https://github.com/gsdlab/clafer) into a `<target directory>` of your choice
  * Tip: it is advised to install both tools into the same `<target directory>`
2. in some `<source directory>`, execute `git clone git://github.com/gsdlab/claferIG.git`
3. in `<source directory>/claferIG`, execute
  * `cabal update`
  * `make`

### Installation

1. execute `make install to=<target directory>`
2. add the `<target directory>` is on your command PATH

#### Note: 
> On Windows, use `/` with the `make` command instead of `\`.

Usage
=====

Clafer Instance Generator can be used in interactive and batch modes, as well as, an API.

Output format
-------------

### Instance data

The instance data notation is very similar to a regular Clafer notation for concrete clafers with a few differences:

* no constraints
* no types and super types
    * except when `--adduidsandtypes` parameter is used
* no clafer and group cardinalities (each clafer has the default group `(0..*)` and clafer `(1..1)` cardinality)
* no clafers not present in the instance

Additionally, the data notation contains concrete values of the clafers and suffix numbers to distinguish among multipe instances of the same clafer.

### Note:
> The instance data models could be read by the Clafer translator if the translator had simple type inference support.

#### Example 

For a model

```clafer
abstract A
    a ?
    b +
    c : integer ?
    d -> E 2
    g -> E 2
        h : integer

abstract E
    f : integer +

a1 : A
e1 : E
e2 : E
```

A possible instance data looks as follows:

```clafer
a1
    b$1
    b$2
    c = 10
    d$1 = e1
    d$2 = e2    
    g1 = e1       
        h$1 = 5     
    g2 = e2
        h$2 = 2

e1
    f$1 = 2
    f$2 = 3
    f$3 = 4 
```

### Near-miss instance

Near-miss instance notation is the same as the instance data notation. Additionally, it indicates which constraints belong to the UnSAT Core.

#### Example 

For a model

```clafer
abstract A
    a ?
    b ?
        [ a ]   // C1

a1 : A
    [ no a ]    // C2
    [ b ]       // C3
```

Constraints C1, C2, and C3 form an UnSAT Core. Removal of any of them will make the model satisfiable. The constraint C1 is part of the model and cannot be removed (part of domain knowledge). Therefore, either C2 or C3 must be removed to remove the inconsistency. 

On possible near-miss instance:

```clafer
a1
    a
    b
```

Here, `C1` and `C3` are satisfied but `C2` is not. To resolve the conflict and assuming that the counter example is actually a correct instance data, the user has to modify the model by removing `C2`. However, should the counter example actually represent incorrect instance data, the user can remove `C3` to resolve the inconsistency.

How it works
------------

The Clafer instance generator:

* translates the input Clafer model (.cfr) to an Alloy model (.als). The compiler's intermediate representation (IR) contains the mapping between Clafer names and Alloy names. The IR also contains the smallest scopes for each Alloy signature to ensure that a valid instance can be found if it exists
* invokes Alloy Analyzer to produce an instance or find an UnSAT core
** given an UnSAT core, removes constraints from the core until an instance is found - that instance represents the counterexample which violates the removed constraints
* translates the instance or the counterexample data produced by Alloy Analyzer to Clafer instance data format using the name map from IR in a reverse direction,
* for a counterexample, translates the counter example in Alloy to Claefr instance data and constraint violations in Alloy into constraint violations in Clafer model
