Sublime Text 2
--------------

We provide a configuration for SublimeREPL for running ClaferIG inside Sublime as a REPL.

### Usage

Use `<CTRL>+I`, `G` to open a Clafer `.cfr` file with ClaferIG. 
This build system assumes that Clafer and ClaferIG executables are in system `PATH`.

### Installation 

Copy `Packages\SublimeREPL\config\ClaferIG` into your home directory Sublime Text 2 folder.

> Note: on Windows 7 and 8, the `Packages` folder is located at `<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\`.
